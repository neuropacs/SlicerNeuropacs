# neuropacs™ Slicer Extension

The neuropacs™ system is a software application intended to receive and analyze
diffusion MRI data from patients aged 40 years and older presenting with Parkinson’s
disease (PD) symptoms. The neuropacs™ system provides a report to aid
neuroradiologists and/or neurologists in identifying patients with Atypical Parkinsonism
(i.e., multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), or progressive supranuclear
palsy (PSP)). The results of the neuropacs™ system are intended to provide
supplemental information in conjunction with a standard neurological assessment and
other clinical tests. Patient management decisions should not be made solely on the basis
of analysis by the neuropacs™ system.
